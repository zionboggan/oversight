# Oversight CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

- **Live registry deployment config.** `docker-compose.yml` now has a `live`
  Caddy profile with public TLS routing for the registry, beacon, OCSP-style,
  and license-style hostnames. `Caddyfile` covers the full registry v1
  read/evidence/tlog surface plus beacon routes, with all hostnames coming
  from environment variables. `.env.example` documents public-safe defaults
  and leaves secrets blank.
- **Registry operator token.** The Python reference registry can now require
  `OVERSIGHT_OPERATOR_TOKEN` for `POST /register` and `POST /attribute`.
  The token is optional so local development and unauthenticated conformance
  runs keep working, but production operators can protect write-side APIs
  without changing route shapes. The conformance harness sends the token as
  a bearer header when `OVERSIGHT_OPERATOR_TOKEN` is set.
- **Rust registry operator-token parity.** The Axum + SQLx registry now reads
  `OVERSIGHT_OPERATOR_TOKEN` too and enforces it on `POST /register` and
  `POST /attribute` with the same bearer/header contract as the Python
  registry. Its DNS event route also accepts either `Authorization: Bearer`
  or `X-Oversight-DNS-Secret`, matching the live deployment guide.
- **Rust registry migration tooling.** `oversight-registry` now supports
  `--migrate-from <python-registry.sqlite>` plus `--migrate-dry-run`. It
  copies the Python reference registry's manifests, beacons, watermarks,
  events, and corpus rows into the Rust SQLite schema while preserving event
  IDs, corpus metadata, and registry evidence relationships.
- **Rust registry integrity validation.** `oversight-registry --validate-db`
  now checks migrated Rust registry databases for orphaned attribution rows,
  identity mismatches, malformed manifest JSON, invalid manifest signatures,
  and manifest/file ID divergence before operators declare migration burn-in
  complete. It also validates event/corpus JSON sidecars and tlog index
  uniqueness so corrupted migrated evidence cannot look clean. Rust registry
  writes now fail closed if the local transparency log cannot append, and
  validation checks missing or out-of-range event tlog indexes against the
  on-disk tlog size. Validation also compares event rows to the corresponding
  tlog leaf payload so an index cannot point at unrelated evidence and still
  pass burn-in checks. Local tlog recovery now rejects malformed records,
  non-contiguous indexes, and leaf-hash mismatches instead of silently
  ignoring corrupted lines during startup or validation. `/tlog/range` now
  reads through the same validated tlog API, so malformed or hash-mismatched
  records fail the range request instead of being silently omitted from
  monitor responses. The Python reference tlog now matches that behavior:
  startup and `/tlog/range` fail closed on corrupt leaf records, and new
  leaves carry `leaf_data_hex` so exact leaf bytes survive recovery.
- **Registry v1 error envelope parity.** Python and Rust registry errors now
  return the spec envelope `{error: {code, message}}` for registry failures
  instead of the framework-native string-only shapes. The conformance harness
  now checks `/tlog/range` response shape plus representative
  `signature_invalid`, `sidecar_mismatch`, `missing_field`, and `not_found`
  error envelopes, raising the live/in-process harness to 38 checks.
- **Registry v1 candidate stability note.** Added
  `docs/REGISTRY_V1_STABILITY.md`, which names the candidate-frozen route
  surface, JSON field families, error envelope, conformance gate, breaking
  change rules, and remaining v1.0 burn-in gates for independent registry
  operators.
- **GitHub Actions runtime hygiene.** Main CI workflows opt into the GitHub
  Actions Node 24 runtime before the hosted runner default changes.
- **Rust policy test parity.** Fixed the `oversight-policy` crate's manifest
  fixture after the v0.4.11 `Recipient.p256_pub` schema addition so the full
  Rust workspace test suite compiles again.
- **Deployment docs.** Added `docs/REGISTRY_DEPLOYMENT.md` covering the live
  Compose/Caddy flow, route map, token headers, DNS bridge secret, and local
  versus live conformance commands.
- **Public description refresh.** Updated README/roadmap/embedding copy to
  describe v0.4.11 as the current stable line and the post-tag Rust registry
  deployment and migration work on `main`.
- **Code comment style.** Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidance to prefer
  self-explanatory code and tests over prose-style inline comments, then
  removed noisy implementation comments from the Rust registry path.
- **Source comment guard.** Added `scripts/check_source_comments.py`, a pytest
  wrapper, and a `source-style` GitHub Actions workflow so strict comment-light
  paths fail CI if prose comments are reintroduced.
- **Rust PDF extraction parity.** `oversight-formats` now uses lopdf page text
  extraction plus parsed content-stream operations for PDF fingerprint text
  instead of raw literal scanning. The fallback handles `Tj`, `TJ`, quote
  operators, and array spacing, with new Rust tests covering page-level PDF
  text extraction.
- **Rust image DCT parity.** `oversight-formats` now ports the Python image
  adapter's DCT mid-band spread-spectrum watermarking path using `rustdct`.
  Image watermarking writes the DCT mark and then preserves blind LSB recovery,
  with tests for the Python-compatible mark sequence, DCT verification, and
  adapter round trip.
- **Outlook add-in hosted pilot page.** `integrations/outlook/index.html`
  documents the hosted manifest URL, task pane URL, requested `ReadItem`
  permission, same-origin viewer reuse, sideload steps, and remaining tenant
  load-test gates for the Outlook read-mode inspector.

## v0.4.11 - 2026-05-08 Hardware-keys completion: Python parity, browser support, end-to-end seal

The `OSGT-HW-P256-v1` suite is now implemented end-to-end across all
three reference implementations: Rust core, Python core, and the
public browser inspector. Every layer of the protocol ships every
suite. The only piece deferred to a follow-up is the `PivKeyProvider`
(PKCS#11 binding to actual hardware tokens) and the matching
`--recipient-hw` CLI flag.

- **`oversight_core.crypto`: Python parity for `OSGT-HW-P256-v1`
  (2026-05-08).** New `wrap_dek_for_recipient_p256` and `unwrap_dek_p256`
  mirror the Rust reference byte-for-byte: same HKDF info string
  (`"oversight-hw-p256-v1-dek-wrap"`), same AEAD AAD
  (`"oversight-hw-p256-dek"`), same SEC1 uncompressed (65 byte) wire
  format for the ephemeral public key, same wrapped envelope JSON shape
  including the explicit `"suite"` field. `unwrap_dek_p256` accepts
  either an `EllipticCurvePrivateKey`, a PKCS#8-encoded private key, or
  a raw integer scalar so a future PIV / PKCS#11 binding has a portable
  on-ramp. `oversight_core.container` now recognizes `suite_id = 3` and
  maps it to `OSGT-HW-P256-v1` in `SUITE_ID_TO_NAME`. New
  `tests/test_hw_p256.py` (10 tests) covers the round trip across all
  three private-key input forms, the on-wire envelope shape against
  `SPEC.md` &sect; 5.2, and the negative paths (wrong recipient, wrong
  ephemeral key length, missing fields, AAD binding so a classic
  envelope's bytes do not silently decrypt through the hardware path).

- **`oversight-container`: end-to-end seal/open for `OSGT-HW-P256-v1`
  (2026-05-07).** New `seal_hw_p256` mirrors `seal` but consumes a P-256
  SEC1 uncompressed recipient public key and writes a container with
  `suite_id = 3`. New `open_sealed_with_provider` is the polymorphic
  open path: dispatches on the container's `suite_id` and delegates the
  recipient-side ECDH to a `KeyProvider`. Today it supports classic (with
  `FileKeyProvider`) and HW P-256 (with `SoftwareP256KeyProvider` or any
  future `PivKeyProvider`); a hybrid-aware provider extension lands later.
  Cross-suite mismatches (e.g. an X25519 provider on a HW P-256 container)
  are refused explicitly. `oversight-manifest::Recipient` gains an
  optional `p256_pub: Option<String>` field, gated by `serde(default,
  skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")` so existing JSON manifests
  parse unchanged. Five new round-trip / negative tests; `oversight-
  container` now 17/17, workspace builds clean.

## v0.4.10 - 2026-05-07 Hardware-keys foundation: KeyProvider trait + OSGT-HW-P256-v1

This release lands the abstraction and pure-Rust reference path that the
upcoming `PivKeyProvider` (PKCS#11 against YubiKey / Nitrokey / OnlyKey)
plugs into. Public API is purely additive; all existing v0.4.9 callers
keep working unchanged.

- **`oversight-container`: `OSGT-HW-P256-v1` recognized by the binary
  container (2026-05-07).** Added `SUITE_HW_P256_V1_ID = 3` and extended
  `suite_id_for_manifest` to map the new manifest suite. This is the bridge
  that lets a future `seal_hw_p256` ride the existing container layout
  without reinventing it. New unit test covers the full mapping and asserts
  unknown suites still return `None`. 12/12 container tests; workspace
  build clean.

- **`oversight-crypto`: `OSGT-HW-P256-v1` suite implementation (2026-05-07).**
  P-256 ECDH wrap/unwrap landed alongside the X25519 path so hardware-backed
  recipients (YubiKey / Nitrokey / OnlyKey via PIV) have a complete pure-Rust
  reference to plug into. `wrap_dek_for_recipient_p256` accepts SEC1
  uncompressed (65 byte) recipient public keys and produces `WrappedDekP256`.
  `SoftwareP256KeyProvider` is the in-memory `KeyProvider` impl that
  `PivKeyProvider` will mirror against PKCS#11 next. Cross-suite envelopes
  are rejected explicitly: an X25519 provider passed to a P-256 envelope
  errors out instead of producing garbage. Eight new unit tests covering
  round trips, wrong-recipient rejection, cross-suite rejection, JSON
  envelope round-trip, and a regression check that the classic path still
  works. `SUITE_HW_P256_V1` constant exported. Adds `p256` (RustCrypto) to
  workspace deps with `ecdh` + `arithmetic` features. `oversight-crypto`
  passes 21/21; workspace build clean.

- **`oversight-crypto`: `KeyProvider` trait + `FileKeyProvider` (2026-05-07).**
  The recipient-side ECDH path is now abstracted behind `pub trait KeyProvider`,
  with `FileKeyProvider` shipping as the X25519 file-backed default. New
  `unwrap_dek_with_provider` is byte-identical to `unwrap_dek` for file-backed
  keys (asserted by tests) and is the entry point hardware-backed providers
  (PIV / PKCS#11) will plug into next, per `docs/HARDWARE_KEYS.md`. Public API
  is purely additive: existing `unwrap_dek(wrapped, priv_bytes)` callers are
  unchanged. `KeyAlgorithm::P256` reserved for the upcoming `OSGT-HW-P256-v1`
  suite. Six new unit tests; workspace build clean; `oversight-crypto` passes
  13/13.

## v0.4.9 - 2026-05-07 Hybrid browser decrypt, Rust registry v1, Outlook scaffold

The browser inspector now decrypts post-quantum sealed files end-to-end,
the Rust registry passes the v1 conformance harness 33/33, and a thin
Outlook task-pane scaffold lets us start a tenant pilot. Format watermark
regressions in `oversight-rust/oversight-formats` are also resolved.

- **Outlook add-in scaffold landed (2026-05-07).** New `integrations/outlook/`
  with the Office add-in 1.1 manifest (`MailApp`, read-mode task pane,
  `ReadItem` only), task-pane HTML, and JS that imports the public viewer's
  `parseSealed`, `verifyManifestSignature`, and `decryptSealed` directly
  from `oversightprotocol.dev/viewer/...` rather than reimplementing crypto.
  Decrypts both classic and hybrid suites. Architecture decision recorded in
  `docs/OUTLOOK.md`. Status: scaffold; not yet load-tested in an Outlook
  tenant. Icons (64/128 px) still pending.
- **Browser inspector: hybrid (post-quantum) decrypt shipped (2026-05-03).**
  The viewer at `oversight-protocol.github.io/oversight/viewer/` now decrypts
  `OSGT-HYBRID-v1` sealed files end-to-end, in addition to the
  `OSGT-CLASSIC-v1` path that shipped earlier. Implementation reuses
  WebCrypto X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 and the existing vendored `@noble/ciphers`
  XChaCha20-Poly1305, plus a newly vendored `@noble/post-quantum` ML-KEM-768
  for the post-quantum half of the KEM. KEK is bound X-wing-style over both
  shared secrets and both ephemeral inputs (`ss_x || ss_pq || eph_pub ||
  mlkem_ct`), matching `oversight_core.crypto.hybrid_wrap_dek`. New files
  on the site: `viewer/vendor/noble-post-quantum-ml-kem-0.6.1.js` (+ three
  vendored transitive deps from `@noble/hashes` and `@noble/curves`),
  `viewer/samples/tutorial-hybrid.sealed`, and
  `viewer/samples/tutorial-hybrid-identity.json`. New "Load hybrid tutorial
  identity" button surfaces the test fixture. New tooling:
  `tools/gen_hybrid_sample.py` (self-contained sample generator that mirrors
  the production hybrid wrap construction, runs anywhere `oqs` and
  `cryptography` are available), and `tools/test_hybrid_decrypt_node.mjs`
  (Node-based end-to-end smoke test against Node's WebCrypto).
- `oversight-rust/oversight-registry`: added the missing registry v1
  read-only and beacon surface (`/.well-known/oversight-registry`,
  `/evidence/{file_id}`, `/tlog/head|proof|range`, `/p/{token_id}.png`,
  `/r/{token_id}`, `/v/{token_id}`, `/candidates/semantic`) and tightened
  CORS to the public browser-inspector origins with GET/OPTIONS only. The
  Axum server now passes the existing 33-check
  `tests/test_registry_conformance.py` harness in live-URL mode.
- `oversight-rust/oversight-manifest`: added `canonical_content_hash` and
  `l3_policy` to the signed manifest model so Rust verifies Python-signed
  v0.4.5+ manifests without dropping signed fields before canonicalization,
  while retaining a fallback verification path for older manifests that lack
  those default fields.
- `oversight-rust/oversight-formats`: fixed Rust text/image watermark
  regressions that were failing the workspace test suite. Text embedding now
  keeps L2 trailing-whitespace marks at physical line endings after L1
  zero-width insertion, and image LSB embedding avoids duplicate pixel slots
  that could overwrite earlier payload bits.

## v0.4.8 - 2026-04-29 Mobile-build portability and rustls-webpki security bump

Patch release covering two upstream-driven fixes that landed on `main`
since v0.4.7. No new features and no breaking changes.

- `oversight-rust/oversight-container`: gate the 4 GiB
  `MAX_CIPHERTEXT_BYTES` literal to 64-bit targets and fall back to
  `usize::MAX` on 32-bit. Required to cross-compile the Rust core for
  Android `armv7-linux-androideabi` and `i686-linux-android`, which the
  mobile companion (`oversight-protocol/oversight-mobile`, Flutter +
  Rust via `flutter_rust_bridge`) embeds unchanged. Behavior is preserved
  for any realistic bundle on 32-bit; `usize::MAX` is just under 4 GiB
  on those targets. (PR #4, merged 2026-04-26.)
- `oversight-rust` Cargo.lock: bumped `rustls-webpki` from 0.103.12 to
  0.103.13. Patches a reachable panic in CRL parsing
  (GHSA-82j2-j2ch-gfr8) and an inverted-meaning URI excluded-subtree
  check (rustls/webpki#471). In scope because the Rust registry and
  Rekor clients use rustls for TLS. (Dependabot PR #3, merged 2026-04-29.)

## v0.4.7 - 2026-04-22 Registry federation hardening and conformance harness

Federation stops being aspirational when a second operator can prove
compatibility. v0.4.7 hardens the registry v1 interop spec against the
reference implementation and ships a conformance harness that any
operator can point at their deployment.

- `docs/spec/registry-v1.md`: expanded with the canonicalization algorithm
  (`json.dumps(sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))` over UTF-8), the
  uniform error envelope and `code` vocabulary, a full endpoint table
  including the normative beacon paths (`/p/{token_id}.png`, `/r/{token_id}`,
  `/v/{token_id}`), the `/.well-known/oversight-registry` shape, the
  `/evidence/{file_id}` bundle fields, and the `/tlog/head|proof|range`
  endpoints federated verifiers rely on. Removed a phantom
  `/query/{file_id}` endpoint that was in the draft but never shipped.
- `tests/test_registry_conformance.py`: 32-check harness with two modes.
  In-process against a FastAPI `TestClient` for CI, or against a live URL
  when `OVERSIGHT_REGISTRY_URL` is set. Covers identity, liveness, a full
  signed-manifest registration round trip, attribution by token id,
  evidence bundle shape, transparency-log head, every beacon endpoint,
  and DNS event authentication.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: the registry federation item references the harness
  as the acceptance gate for federation.
- Version bumped to `0.4.7`. No breaking changes.

## v0.4.6 - 2026-04-22 SIEM export: Splunk, Sentinel, and Elastic

Registry beacon events can now be emitted in three SIEM-native formats so
security teams get Oversight data into the incident pipeline they already
run. Formatters are pure; transport is a thin sink layer.

- `oversight_core/siem.py`: new module. Normalized `OversightEvent` model
  built from the registry `events` table, pure formatters for Splunk HEC,
  Elastic Common Schema 8.x, and Microsoft Sentinel (Log Analytics custom
  logs), plus `sentinel_authorization()` helper that signs the Data
  Collector API `Authorization` header per Microsoft's recipe.
- `cli/oversight.py`: new `oversight siem export` subcommand. Streams
  events as JSON lines to stdout, a file, or an HTTPS collector. Supports
  `--since`, `--limit`, repeatable `--header`, and Splunk source/sourcetype/
  index overrides. Opens the registry database read-only so it is safe
  to run against a live service.
- `docs/SIEM.md`: operator integration guide covering each of the three
  SIEMs, the event field dictionary, the Sentinel HMAC signing window,
  and the honest beacon-absence caveat. Also surfaced from the website
  docs index.
- `tests/test_siem_unit.py`: 11 focused unit tests covering envelope
  shape per format, empty-field suppression, SQLite row mapping,
  read-only iteration, Sentinel HMAC stability, and action-name
  coverage for every beacon kind.
- `oversight_core/__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`: version bumped to
  `0.4.6`. No breaking changes; SIEM is additive.

## v0.4.5 - 2026-04-20 L3 safety, GUI, and registry federation docs

Review-driven hardening from `P:/Oversight/oversight-protocol-review.md`.

- `oversight_core/l3_policy.py`: new L3 safety policy engine. L3 defaults off
  for legal, regulatory, technical/spec, source-code, SQL, log, and structured
  data classes; explicit `full`, `boilerplate`, and `off` modes are supported.
- `cli/oversight.py` and `cli/oversight_rich.py`: seal-time L3 disclosure now
  requires acknowledgement when L3 is enabled, and seal manifests record the
  applied L3 policy.
- `oversight_core/manifest.py`: manifests now carry `canonical_content_hash`
  so auditors can diff recipient copies against the original source bytes.
- `oversight_core/watermark.py` and `oversight_core/formats/text.py`: high-level
  L3 application is opt-in; L1/L2 remain available by default.
- `cli/gui.py`: added a Tkinter desktop GUI for key generation, sealing, and
  opening files (`oversight gui`) so non-technical users have a starter path.
- GUI and CLI output writes now fail closed against private-key overwrites,
  same-path writes, reserved Windows device names, malformed key files, and
  non-UTF-8 watermark attempts. Private-key writes use atomic replacement and
  restrictive permissions/ACL hardening where supported.
- `.sealed` parsing now rejects tampered suite IDs, malformed manifest/wrapped-DEK
  JSON, unknown manifest fields, and trailing bytes after ciphertext.
- `oversight-rust/oversight-container`: Rust now mirrors the Python parser's
  strictness by rejecting suite-byte tamper and trailing bytes after the
  authenticated ciphertext region.
- `docs/security.md`: documented L3 collusion/canonicalization limits, layer
  survival properties, passive beacon limits, jurisdiction-by-IP limits, and
  RFC 3161 timestamp semantics.
- `docs/spec/registry-v1.md`: added a registry federation/interoperability
  draft for independent compatible registry operators.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: corrected launch sequencing, dropped near-term FedRAMP,
  scoped ecosystem plugins to Outlook-first, and prioritized SIEM integration
  before SOC 2 / ISO 27001 work.
- Raised vulnerable dependency floors flagged by Dependabot/PyPI advisory
  checks: setuptools, cryptography, PyNaCl, pydantic, python-multipart,
  Pillow, and pypdf now require patched minimums; Rust manifest floors
  now pin patched minima for sqlx, tokio, rand_core, zip, chrono, regex,
  once_cell, and tracing-subscriber.
- Added focused regression coverage in `tests/test_l3_policy_unit.py`.

## v0.4.4 - 2026-04-20 security hardening

Security patch line started from the `v0.4.3` Python package baseline
(`0b1a4ab`) and incorporates the Codex review fixes made on 2026-04-20.
This is the current `main` download line. Historical `v0.5.0` Rekor/Rust
work remains in git history and the Rust workspace, but the Python package
metadata now intentionally advances from `0.4.3` to `0.4.4` so users do not
confuse the hardened tree with the vulnerable `v0.4.3` baseline.

- `oversight_core/container.py`: `max_opens` now increments only after a
  successful decrypt, and unsafe `seal_multi()` is disabled until the
  manifest format can honestly represent multiple recipients.
- `oversight_core/policy.py`: `LOCAL_ONLY` counter locking now works on
  Windows, and `REGISTRY` / `HYBRID` fail closed instead of silently using
  local state.
- `oversight_core/rekor.py`: offline verification now rejects DSSE envelopes
  whose subject digest does not match the expected content hash.
- `registry/server.py`: Rekor attestations now use real watermark mark IDs
  and the manifest's actual `content_hash`, and `/register` now rejects
  unsigned beacon / watermark sidecars that do not match the signed manifest.
- `oversight_core/formats/text.py`: text adapter now applies L3 before L2/L1,
  matching the core watermark pipeline.
- `oversight_core/tlog.py`: empty-tree roots now use the RFC 6962 Merkle
  hash (`SHA-256("")`) instead of an all-zero placeholder.
- `oversight_core/__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and the Rich CLI banner:
  version metadata is now `0.4.4`, marking this post-`0.4.3` hardening train.
- `oversight_dns/server.py` and `registry/server.py`: DNS beacon callbacks now
  support a shared `OVERSIGHT_DNS_EVENT_SECRET`, and non-loopback callbacks
  fail closed when no secret is configured.
- `registry/server.py`: evidence bundles now include local transparency-log
  inclusion proofs for recorded events, not just the signed tree head.
- `oversight-rust`: removed the direct `rand` dependency in favor of
  `rand_core::OsRng`, clearing the low-severity `rand` advisory path.
- `oversight-rust/oversight-registry`: `/dns_event` now requires
  `OVERSIGHT_DNS_EVENT_SECRET` for non-loopback callbacks, signed
  beacon/watermark artifacts fail registration when malformed instead of being
  silently dropped, and Rekor attestation skips watermarkless registrations
  rather than logging `mark:<file_id>`.
- `oversight-rust/oversight-container` and `oversight-rust/oversight-policy`:
  Rust opens can now enforce `max_opens` after successful recipient decrypt,
  `REGISTRY` / `HYBRID` modes fail closed instead of falling back to local
  counters, and Rust `seal_multi()` fails closed until recipient-honest
  manifests exist.
- `oversight-rust/oversight-rekor`: offline verification now mirrors Python by
  rejecting DSSE envelopes whose subject digest does not match the expected
  content hash.
- `oversight-rust/oversight-formats`: DOCX metadata insertion no longer reports
  success when `<cp:keywords>` is missing, and PDF processing rejects indirect
  Launch / JavaScript / unsafe URI actions before rewriting files.
- Added focused regression coverage in `tests/test_policy_unit.py`,
  `tests/test_registry_unit.py`, `tests/test_rekor_unit.py`,
  `tests/test_text_format_unit.py`, and `tests/test_tlog_unit.py`.

Patch sequence on top of `v0.4.3`:

1. `0.4.3` / `0b1a4ab`: Rich CLI, anti-stripping defenses, and L3
   integration baseline.
2. `0.4.4` / `dab6157`: policy and Rekor verification hardening.
3. `0.4.4` / `4d60e3b`: registry Rekor mark indexing fix.
4. `0.4.4` / `20a566b`: multi-recipient sealing fails closed until the
   manifest can represent multiple recipients honestly.
5. `0.4.4` / `482f294`: default beacon/registry domain updated from
   `oversight.example` to `oversightprotocol.dev`.
6. `0.4.4` / `7712f98`: signed registry sidecars enforced and RFC 6962
   empty tlog roots fixed.
7. `0.4.4` / `0a7a2da`: package, core, and CLI version metadata
   aligned to the hardened `0.4.4` line.
8. `0.4.4` / `69e50aa`: public changelog patch chronology documented.
9. `0.4.4` / `26db8d3`: DNS evidence hardening, Rust RNG dependency
   cleanup, and evidence-bundle inclusion proofs.
10. `0.5.0+` / `b9bee41`: Claude-added Rust format adapters, Axum registry,
    and USENIX benchmark scaffolding.
11. `0.5.0+` / current hardening commit: Codex audit fixes for the new Rust
    registry/container/policy/Rekor/format-adapter security regressions.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-04-19

First release with public-Rekor attestations. Now hosted at
https://github.com/oversight-protocol/oversight (so the v0.5 predicate URI
resolves for any third-party verifier).

### Session B (registry wiring + e2e + backcompat)
- `registry/server.py`: `/register` now opt-in attests each registration into
  a public Rekor v2 log. Off by default; opt in with
  `OVERSIGHT_REKOR_ENABLED=1`. Failures non-fatal — local SQLite tlog stays
  authoritative for "list marks for issuer X" queries.
- `oversight_core/rekor.py upload_dsse`: fixed three wire-shape bugs against
  current rekor-tiles proto (`verifier`→`verifiers` array, `keyDetails` as
  sibling of `publicKey`, `raw_bytes` carries DER not PEM). Verified live
  against `log2025-1.rekor.sigstore.dev` — got real `log_index` returned.
- `tests/test_rekor_e2e.py`: 2 live tests, gated behind
  `OVERSIGHT_REKOR_E2E=1` so default runs do not append entries to the
  public log.
- `tests/test_rekor_backcompat.py`: 5 offline checks of v0.4 contract
  preservation.

### Session C (Rust crate + cross-language conformance + version bump)
- New crate `oversight-rust/oversight-rekor`: bit-identical port of
  `oversight_core.rekor`. 9 inline tests cover PAE byte-exactness,
  sign/verify round trip, tamper + wrong-key rejection, statement shape,
  canonical envelope JSON, and offline TLE inclusion check.
- New conformance suite `oversight-rust/tests/conformance_rekor.sh`: proves
  Python ↔ Rust bit-identity in 4 ways — PAE bytes, Python-signs/Rust-verifies,
  Rust-signs/Python-verifies, canonical payload bytes for the same statement.
- Version bumped to 0.5.0 across `oversight-rust/Cargo.toml`, `README.md`,
  `docs/SPEC.md`.

Hard constraints respected: no new crypto primitives (RustCrypto +
`cryptography`'s Ed25519 only), test count additions-only, Python ↔ Rust
bit-identity proven by conformance script.

## Unreleased — v0.5 Session A (2026-04-19)
- Added `docs/V05_REKOR_PLAN.md`: full Rekor v2 migration plan, verified
  against current upstream API (Rekor v2 GA 2025-10-10, DSSE + hashedrekord
  only, tile-backed reads, no online proof API, public log shard rotates
  ~6 months).
- Added `oversight_core/rekor.py` (~280 LOC): DSSE statement construction,
  PAE-exact signing/verification against the spec, Rekor v2 `/api/v2/log/entries`
  upload helper, offline inclusion-check helper, and `build_bundle()` shaper.
- Added `docs/predicates/registration-v1.md`: the URI the predicate type
  resolves to, with privacy contract and field schema.
- Added `tests/test_rekor_unit.py` with 10 offline unit tests covering DSSE
  PAE, sign/verify, tamper rejection, wrong-key rejection, statement shape,
  canonical envelope JSON, offline bundle verification, the recipient-pubkey
  privacy guarantee, predicate-version int, and 5-year-replay bundle fields.
- Six desktop-review fixes baked into Session A before commit:
  - Recipient X25519 pubkey now SHA-256 hashed before going on-log
    (deanonymization fix).
  - Predicate URI pinned to git-tagged GitHub path, not `oversight.dev`.
  - Bundle gained `bundle_schema: 2` integer + `log_pubkey_pem` +
    `checkpoint` + `log_entry_schema` + optional `rfc3161_chain`.
- Conformance script `oversight-rust/tests/conformance_cross_lang.sh` now
  derives REPO_ROOT from its own location instead of `/home/claude` hardcode.
- `HANDOFF.md` gained explicit "what NOT to accept from a future Claude
  session" section per the v0.4.1 retro.

Test count: 76 → 86 (additions only, baseline conformance still green).

## v0.4.1 — 2026-04-18

Cosmetic polish only, no functionality changes.

### Fixed
- Removed unused `std::path::Path` import from `oversight-policy` — clean
  `cargo build --workspace --release` with zero warnings.
- Rust workspace version bumped to 0.4.1 across all crates via
  `version.workspace = true`.

### No behavioral changes
All 76 tests (31 Python + 42 Rust + 3 conformance) still green.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-04-17

**Rust port expands from core to core+enforcement+semantics.** Three new Rust
crates; Python reference unchanged in functionality but with RFC 6962 fix.

### Added

- **`oversight-tlog`** Rust crate (367 LOC). RFC 6962-compliant Merkle tree
  from day one — left-heavy largest-power-of-2 split, not the promote-odd
  shortcut from the Python v0.2 tlog. Signed tree heads, inclusion proofs,
  durable append (fsync), automatic recovery on reopen. 7 tests.
- **`oversight-policy`** Rust crate (284 LOC). TOCTOU-safe `max_opens`
  enforcement via `fs2::FileExt::lock_exclusive` + atomic temp-file rename.
  File-ID sanitization against path traversal. Jurisdiction / not_after /
  not_before checks. 6 tests.
- **`oversight-semantic`** Rust crate (345 LOC + 156-line dictionary file).
  Full port of the 151-class synonym dictionary and L3 watermarking.
  Airgap-strip-survivor verified (tests embed, then strip zero-width and
  trailing whitespace, then verify — still attributes). URL / email / code
  / path / hex / base64 skip regions. 8 tests.
- **Fuzz harness** (`oversight-rust/fuzz/`) — two `cargo-fuzz` targets
  hammering the container parser and manifest parser. Excluded from main
  workspace so normal builds don't need nightly. README with 24-hour
  pre-audit run recommendation.
- **`docs/HARDWARE_KEYS.md`** — vendor-neutral setup guide for YubiKey /
  Nitrokey / OnlyKey. Covers PIN/PUK setup, PIV slot 9d provisioning,
  Oversight identity-file format for hardware-backed recipients, curve
  choice rationale (P-256 for PIV compat vs X25519 file-backed), revocation
  procedure, threat model, deployment checklist.

### Fixed

- **`oversight_core/tlog.py`** now RFC 6962 compliant. Replaced the
  promote-odd-trailing shortcut with the canonical largest-power-of-2
  left-heavy split. Added `_rfc6962_mth`, `_rfc6962_path`,
  `verify_inclusion_proof` helpers. Tested with asymmetric sizes
  (n ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,7,8,16,17,100}) — every leaf's proof verifies;
  tampered proofs rejected. Old custom Merkle logic removed.
- **Mutex self-deadlock** in `oversight-tlog::inclusion_proof` — was
  holding the leaves lock while calling `root()` which also locks.
  Fixed by dropping the lock before invoking `root()`.
- **`oversight-semantic` round-trip bug** — `embed_synonyms` could pick
  hyphenated variants like `"write-up"` that `WORD_RE` tokenizes as two
  separate words, desyncing the verify sequence. Both embed and verify
  now explicitly skip non-round-trippable variants (whitespace or hyphen).

### Changed

- **Workspace version** bumped to `0.4.0`. Python reference remains `v0.3`
  (unchanged feature set, one correctness fix).
- **SealedFile** gained `#[derive(Debug)]` to support test assertions with
  `{:?}` formatting.

### Known limitations (unchanged from v0.3)

- Paraphrasing attack defeats all three watermark levels.
- Airgapped readers leave no network beacon.
- Hardware-backed recipients require v0.5+ `KeyProvider` abstraction (not
  yet implemented — currently file-backed only).
- Format adapters (image DCT, PDF, DOCX) remain Python-only until v0.6.
- Registry server (FastAPI) remains Python-only until v1.0.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-04-17

See earlier commits. Initial Rust core + FreeTSA RFC 3161 + cross-language
conformance + SENTINEL→Oversight rename + Nitro→YubiKey pivot.

## v0.2.1 and earlier

Python-only; see git history.
